PaymentDateForecastor&amp;Visualizer

This is just a personal idea and project where I just wanted to forecast and visualize all the future payments that I have to make for mobile recharges for me and my parents.

Functionality - The excel file can be used to forecast and visualize in a calendar, all the future payment dates (till the required range) when the initial payment dates of prepaid recharges of 3 people (can be extended for any number of people) and their plan durations are given as inputs.

PymtDatesForecast - This sheet is where inputs are captured and forecast data is stored.
                    Just input start dates and tenures.
                    For extending the forecast data further - just add required number of new rows at the end of the table.
PaymentTimeline   - The forecast data in the previous sheet is visualized int this sheet.
                    Select the last four rows and drag down with Fill Handle in multiples of 4 to further extend the calender.
